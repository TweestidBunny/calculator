# Calculator

Here we have a rather simple calulator. Nothing
overly grand, and it doesn't do a dozen differnt things.

It can add, subtract, multiply and divide.
It can do calculations on floating numbers.
A user can clear the screen, and delete a mistaken key press.

This is the last project in [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com) foundations.
Using HTML to make the structure of the calculator, and CSS
for styling, a graphical representation will be made.

Then using JavaScript, the calculator will get functionality.
Again, this will be nothing super fancy, it will do basic calculations,
and nothing more.

A user will only be able to do a calculation on 2 numbers, instead
of multiples, and arithmetic precendence will not matter.
In other words, no PEMDAS, and no... well... as the P represents,
a user will not be able to put anything in parentheses.

Just this plus that, another this minus another that, and
another that multiplied by that. Yes, the result of the last
calculation will be stored, and able to be worked on. However,
just like every other calculator out there, if it is not used, it is
discarded. But while it's there, you can do another calculation with it.
